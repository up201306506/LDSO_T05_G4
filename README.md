Project LDSO 2016/2017

### Vision Statement
This project objective is to build a platform to provide users a way to exchange goods and services in their community.
This process of exchanging and sharing goods and services is already happening between small and disperse communities in almost all big cities.

This tool would provide these small communities a place to go to in order to be more organized, more appealing to new members and a simpler work tool this kind of process.
This tool would provide these communities the ability to be more communicative, more efficient and also to work together between other communities with similar interests.

At the moment, all these communities differentiate themselves by some details on the exchange. Some use an alternative coin, some do not, and some just use a time bank system. The idea is to provide them all with an easier tool to help the communities and to join them all in the same service platform.
