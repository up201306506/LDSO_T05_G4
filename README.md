Project LDSO 2016/2017

### Vision Statement
This project objective is to build a platform to provide users a way to exchange goods and services in their community.
This process of exchanging and sharing goods and services is already happening between small and disperse communities in almost all big cities.
This tool would provide these small communities a place to go to in order to be more organized, more appealing to new members and a simpler work tool this kind of process.
This tool would provide these communities the ability to be more communicative, more efficient and also to work together between other communities with similar interests.




At the moment these communities differentiate themselves by some details on the exchange. For example some use an alternative coin, some allow this coin to be converted in euros, some dont use coin and just offer things (freecycle), and some just use services (banco de tempo). The idea is to provide them all with a tool to help them or to join them in one providing all the services at the same platform.
